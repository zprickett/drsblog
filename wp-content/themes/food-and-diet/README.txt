The quickest way to start customsing your theme is by changing the template parts. Anything that has 'content-' in the name is a template part used for respective post format, ie:

content-aside.php
content-image.php
content-link.php
content-page.php
content-quote.php
content-status.php
content-none.php
content.php

These files just contain very simple content - not all the surrounding code. The previous files are loaded through get_template_part() from:

index
image
page
single
search
tag
archive
author
category
